## 🧠 Engineering Mindset: What & Why

> "Engineering isn't just coding. It's structured thinking to solve real problems."

| Trait              | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔍 Problem Solving | Break big problems into small actionable parts   |
| ⚙️ System Thinking | See how parts interact in larger systems         |
| 🧪 Experimentation | Test, iterate, and improve through failure       |
| 💡 Curiosity       | Always ask *"why?"* and *"how?"*                 |
| 📈 Optimization    | Not just build — make it better, faster, cleaner |
