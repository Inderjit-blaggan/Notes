## 🧑‍💻 Phase 7: AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp: 
### Build a production-grade microblogging platform, gaining experience in areas such as containerization, serverless computing, authentication, databases, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code

1. **AWS IAM & Billing** – Set up secure user access and configure cost monitoring with budgets and alerts.
2. **Docker & ECR** – Containerize apps and push images to Elastic Container Registry for deployment.
3. **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** – Run containers serverlessly without managing EC2 infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Phase 8: System Design Fundamentals (10-Line Summary)

1. **Scalability** – Design systems to handle increasing load by scaling horizontally or vertically.
2. **Reliability** – Ensure system uptime and fault tolerance through redundancy and failover strategies.([GeeksforGeeks][2])
3. **Availability** – Maximize system uptime using techniques like load balancing and replication.
4. **Latency** – Optimize response times by minimizing delays in data processing and transmission.
5. **Throughput** – Increase the number of requests processed per unit time by optimizing resources.
6. **Consistency** – Maintain data accuracy across distributed systems, balancing with availability.
7. **Partition Tolerance** – Ensure the system continues to operate despite network partitions.
8. **Caching** – Improve performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user.([GeeksforGeeks][2])
9. **Load Balancing** – Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.([GeeksforGeeks][2])
10. **Database Sharding** – Partition databases to distribute data across multiple machines for scalability.([GeeksforGeeks][2])
